DSP i_ariane/i_cva6/ex_stage_i/i_mult/i_multiplier/mult_result_d__1 output is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset (i_ariane/i_cva6/ex_stage_i/i_mult/i_multiplier/mult_result_q_reg[5]__1). This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	tck_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to H15
	tck_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

REQP-1840#19 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 i_ariane/i_cva6/i_frontend/btb_gen.i_btb/gen_fpga_btb.gen_btb_ram[0].i_btb_ram/Mem_DP_reg has an input control pin i_ariane/i_cva6/i_frontend/btb_gen.i_btb/gen_fpga_btb.gen_btb_ram[0].i_btb_ram/Mem_DP_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[9] (net: i_ariane/i_cva6/i_frontend/btb_gen.i_btb/gen_fpga_btb.gen_btb_ram[0].i_btb_ram/ADDRBWRADDR[4]) which is driven by a register (i_ariane/i_cva6/issue_stage_i/i_issue_read_operands/branch_predict_o_reg[predict_address][17]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
