RISC-V Instructions
===================

Introduction
------------------

In this document, we present ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) for C32VA6_v5.0.0, illustrating different supported instructions, the Base Integer Instruction set RV32I, and also other instructions in some extensions supported by the core as:

* RV32M        – Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division Instructions
* RV32A        – Standard Extension for Atomic Instructions
* RV32C        – Standard Extension for Compressed Instructions
* RV32Zicsr    – Standard Extension for CSR Instructions
* RV32Zifencei – Standard Extension for Instruction-Fetch Fence

The base RISC-V ISA has fixed-length 32-bit instructions or 16-bit instructions (the C32VA6_v5.0.0 support C extension), so that must be naturally aligned on 4-byte boundary or 2-byte boundary.
The C32VA6_v5.0.0 supports:

* Only 1 hart,
* No misaligned memory accesses.

General purpose registers
--------------------------

As shown in the Table 1.1, there are 31 general-purpose registers x1–x31, which hold integer values. Register x0 is hardwired to the constant 0. There is no hardwired subroutine return address link register, but the standard software calling convention uses register x1 to hold the return address on a call. For C32VA6_v5.0.0, the x registers are 32 bits wide. There is one additional register also 32 bits wide: the program counter pc holds the address of the current instruction.

Table 1.1 shows the general-purpose registers :

RV32C Compressed Instructions
--------------------------------

RVC uses a simple compression scheme that offers shorter 16-bit versions of common 32-bit RISC-V
instructions when:

    • the immediate or address offset is small;
    • one of the registers is the zero register (x0), the ABI link register (x1), or the ABI stack pointer (x2);
    • the destination register and the first source register are identical;
    • the registers used are the 8 most popular ones.

The C extension is compatible with all other standard instruction extensions. The C extension
allows 16-bit instructions to be freely intermixed with 32-bit instructions, with the latter now able
to start on any 16-bit boundary. With the addition of the C extension, JAL and JALR instructions
will no longer raise an instruction misaligned exception.

Any bit that is high in rs1 will cause the corresponding bit to be set in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable. Other bits in the CSR are unaffected (though CSRs might have side effects when written), if rs1=x0, then the instruction will not write to the CSR at all, and so shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write, such as raising illegal instruction exceptions on accesses to read-only CSRs.

Other bits in the CSR are unaffected (though CSRs might have side effects when written), if rs1=x0, then the instruction will not write to the CSR at all, and so shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write, such as raising illegal instruction exceptions on accesses to read-only CSRs.

    **Pseudocode**: t = CSRs[csr]; CSRs[csr] = t & ∼x[rs1]; x[rd] = t

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: attempts to access a non-existent CSR raise an illegal instruction exception, attempts to access a CSR without appropriate privilege level or to write a read-only register also raise illegal instruction exceptions.

- **CSRRWI**: Control and Status Register Read and Write Immediate

    **Format**: csrrwi rd, csr, uimm[4:0]

    **Description**: reads the old value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to 32 bits, then writes it to integer register rd. The zero-extends immediate is written to the CSR. If rd=x0, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not cause any of the side-effects that might occur on a CSR read.

    **Pseudocode**: x[rd] = CSRs[csr]; CSRs[csr] = zext(uimm[4:0])

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: attempts to access a non-existent CSR raise an illegal instruction exception, attempts to access a CSR without appropriate privilege level or to write a read-only register also raise illegal instruction exceptions.

- **CSRRSI**: Control and Status Register Read and Set Immediate

    **Format**: csrrsi rd, csr, uimm[4:0]

    **Description**: reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to 32 bits, and writes it to integer register rd. The zero-extends immediate value is treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions to be set in the CSR. Any bit that is high in zero-extends immediate will cause the corresponding bit to be set in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable. Other bits in the CSR are unaffected (though CSRs might have side effects when written), if the uimm[4:0] field is zero, then these instructions will not write to the CSR, and shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write.

    **Pseudocode**: t = CSRs[csr]; CSRs[csr] = t | zext(uimm[4:0]); x[rd] = t

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: attempts to access a non-existent CSR raise an illegal instruction exception, attempts to access a CSR without appropriate privilege level or to write a read-only register also raise illegal instruction exceptions.

- **CSRRCI**: Control and Status Register Read and Clear Immediate

    **Format**: csrrci rd, csr, uimm[4:0]

    **Description**: reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to 32 bits, and writes it to integer register rd. The zero-extends immediate value is treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions to be cleared in the CSR. Any bit that is high in zero-extends immediate will cause the corresponding bit to be set in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable. Other bits in the CSR are unaffected (though CSRs might have side effects when written), if the uimm[4:0] field is zero, then these instructions will not write to the CSR, and shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write.

    **Pseudocode**: t = CSRs[csr]; CSRs[csr] = t & ∼zext(uimm[4:0]); x[rd] = t

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: attempts to access a non-existent CSR raise an illegal instruction exception, attempts to access a CSR without appropriate privilege level or to write a read-only register also raise illegal instruction exceptions.

RV32Zifencei Instruction-Fetch Fence
--------------------------------------

- **FENCE.I**: Fence Instruction

    **Format**: fence.i

    **Description**: The FENCE.I instruction is used to synchronize the instruction and data streams. RISC-V does not guarantee that stores to instruction memory will be made visible to instruction fetches on the same RISC-V hart until a FENCE.I instruction is executed. A FENCE.I instruction only ensures that a subsequent instruction fetch on a RISC-V hart will see any previous data stores already visible to the same RISC-V hart.

    **Pseudocode**: Fence(Store, Fetch)

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: NONE

Illegal Instruction
---------------------------

This section describe all kind of Illegal Instruction, in this case the Core generate an illegal instruction exception.

- **ILLEGAL OPCODE**: any instruction (compressed or not compressed) with a non supported opcode is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL FUNCT2**: any instruction (R4type) with a non supported FUNCT2 is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL FUNCT3**: any instruction (Rtype, R4type, Itype, Stype or Atype) with a non supported FUNCT3 is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL FUNCT5**: any instruction (Atype) with a non supported FUNCT5 is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL FUNCT7**: any instruction (Rtype) with a non supported FUNCT7 is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL CSR**: any CSR instruction attempts to access a non-existent is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL PRIVILEGE LEVEL**: any CSR instruction attempts to access a CSR without appropriate privilege level is an illegal instruction

- **ILLEGAL ACCESS TYPE CSR**: any CSR instruction attempts to write a read-only CSR a non-existent is an illegal instruction
