CV32A6 Subsystem
================

The CV32A6 v0.1.0 is a subsystem composed of the modules and protocol interfaces as illustrated `CV32A6 v0.1.0 modules`_
The processor is a Harvard-based modern architecture.
Instructions are issued in-order through the DECODE stage and executed out-of-order but committed in-order.
The processor is Single issue, that means that at maximum one instruction per cycle can be issued to the EXECUTE stage.

The CV32A6 implements a 6-stage pipeline composed of PC Generation, Instruction Detch, Instruction Decode, Issue stage, Execute stage and Commit stage.
At least 6 cycles are needed to execute one instruction.

Functionality
-------------

CV32A6 v0.1.0 implements a configuration which allows to connect coprocessor through CV-X-IF coprocessor interface, but the lack of MMU, A extension and data cache prevent from executing Linux.

CVA6 memory interface complies with AXI5 specification including the Atomic_Transactions property support as defined in [AXI] section E1.1.

CVA6 coprocessor interface complies with CV-X-IF protocol specification as defined in [CV-X-IF].

The CV32A6 v0.1.0 core is fully synthesizable. It has been designed mainly for ASIC designs, but FPGA synthesis is supported as well.

For ASIC synthesis, the whole design is completely synchronous and uses positive-edge triggered flip-flops. The core occupies an area of about 80 kGE. The clock frequency can be more than 1GHz depending of technology.


Architecture and Modules
----------------------------

The CV32A6 v0.1.0 subsystem is composed of 8 modules.
