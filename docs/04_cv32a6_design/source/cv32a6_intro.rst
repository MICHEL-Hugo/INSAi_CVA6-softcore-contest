.. _CV32A6_INTRO:

Introduction
=============

The OpenHW Group uses `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ to describe the release status of its IP.
This document describes v0.1.0 of the CV32A6.
This is not intended to be a formal release of CVA6.
Currently, the first planned release of CVA6 is the CV32A6 v0.2.0.

CVA6 is a 6-stage in-order and single issue processor core which implements the RISC-V instruction set.
CVA6 can be configured as a 32- or 64-bit core (RV32 or RV64), called CV32A6 or CV64A6.
This document describes an initial version (v0.1.0) of the CV32A6 processor configuration.

The objective of this document is to provide enough information to allow the RTL modification (by designers) and the RTL verification (by verificators).
This document is not dedicated to CVA6 users looking for information to develop software like instructions or registers.

The CVA6 architecture is illustrated in the following figure extracted from a paper written by F.Zaruba and L.Benini.

CV32A6 is a standards-compliant 32-bit processor fully compliant with RISC-V specifications: [RVunpriv], [RVpriv] and [RVdbg] and passes [RVcompat] compatibility tests, as requested by [GEN-10] in [CVA6req].


Documentation framework
-----------------------

The framework of this document is inspired by the Common Criteria. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (referred to as Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification.

Description of the framework:

* Processor is split into module corresponding to the main modules of the design
* Modules can contain several modules
* Each module is described in a chapter, which contains the following subchapters: *Description*, *Functionalities*, *Architecture and Modules* and *Registers* (if any)
* The subchapter *Description* describes the main features of the submodule, the interconnections between the current module and the others and the inputs/outputs interface.
* The subchapter *Functionality* lists in details the module functionalities. Please avoid using the RTL signal names to explain the functionalities.
* The subchapter *Architecture and Modules* provides a drawing to present the module hierarchy, then the functionalities covered by the module
* The subchapter *Registers* specifies the module registers if any
