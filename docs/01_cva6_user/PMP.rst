PMP
===
The CVA6 includes a Physical Memory Protection (PMP) unit. The PMP is both
statically and dynamically configurable. The static configuration is performed
through the top level parameters ``CVA6Cfg.NrPMPEntries``. The dynamic
configuration is performed through the CSRs described in Control and Status
Registers. A maximum of 16 PMP entries are supported.

All PMP CSRs are always implemented, but CSRs (or bitfields of CSRs) related to
PMP entries with number ``CVA6Cfg.NrPMPEntries`` and above are hardwired to
zero. All PMPs reset to zero.

When the ``L`` (Lock) bit is set, PMPs are also enforced in M-mode.

The PMP grain is ``2**G+2``. Only a PMP granularity of 8 bytes (``G=1``) is
supported in CVA6. PMP address length is equal to the processors physical
address length. Since ``G=1`` the ``NA4`` modes is not selectable.

Writes to ``pmpaddr`` are WARL and depend on the address mode. For naturally
aligned power-of 2 addressing mode (``NAPOT``) it is set to ``1``, for top
boundary of an arbitrary range (``TOR``) or ``OFF`` it is set to ``0``.
