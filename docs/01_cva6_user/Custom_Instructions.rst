Custom RISC-V instructions
==========================
As of now, CVA6 does not implement custom RISC-V instructions.

The team is looking for contributors to implement the ``fence.t`` instruction that ensures that the execution time of subsequent instructions is unrelated with predecessor instructions.

The user or integrator can also use the CV-X-IF coprocessor interface to implement their own extensions, without modifying the core.
