# - the required binutils source is in src/binutils-gdb
# - the required GCC source is in src/gcc
# - the required newlib is in src/newlib
# - the user invoking this script has sufficient permissions

# - there are no restrictions on the parallelism of the build process
#   ("make -j" without an explicit job limit causes no significant harm)
#
# Builds of individual tools are performed under the matching

# - If there is no Makefile, run configure, then build and install.
# - If the first configure attempt failed try making 'clean' and 'distclean'
#   targets.
# - In case of build error in GCC once configured, remove the target-specific
#   build subdirectories and try making again.
# - binutils and GCC are built with CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS set to "-O2"
#   ("production" mode: no debug, stripping disabled = 10x smaller binaries).
# - CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are left unset for newlib.

# Disable debug support to reduce size of executables and speed up their launching.
